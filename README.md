# 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person has Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice measurements using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.


## 📌 Problem Statement

Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and speech. Early detection is crucial for better treatment planning.  
This project builds a classification model that predicts Parkinson’s Disease from voice-based features.


## 📂 Dataset

• Source: Parkinson’s Disease Dataset  
• Samples: 195  
• Features: 22 biomedical voice measurements  
• Target:
  - `1` → Parkinson’s Positive  
  - `0` → Healthy
